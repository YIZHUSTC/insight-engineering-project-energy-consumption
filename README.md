# insight-engineering-project-energy-consumption
# Introduction
Monitor and analyze the energy consumption of commercial buildings

# User Case
Advanced monitoring system is more and more widely applied in commercial buildings nowadays. This project provides the bussiness owners the capability to evaluate and compare the energy consumption, to improve the energy efficiency. The business owners can continuously monitor their different types of energy consumption and compare with other similar businees around the area. This can effectively help them improve the energy efficiency. Both Real-time analysis and batch analytics based on historical data are needed.

# Data Set
Commercial and Residential Hourly Load Profiles for all TMY3 Locations in the United States (20 GB)
